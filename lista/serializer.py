"""
This file contains the serializers for various models in the Django application, facilitating 
the conversion of model instances into JSON format for easy API interaction.

Models Handled:
1. User: Serializes all fields of the built-in User model from Django's authentication system.
2. ListItem: Serializes a model representing individual items in a list, including attributes such
   as user (the owner of the item) and images (optional associated images).
3. GroupList: Serializes a model that represents a group of users who can share a ListItem,
   including additional logic to fetch the ID of the user who shared the list.
4. ListItemImage: Serializes a model that stores images associated with ListItem objects.
5. Customization: Serializes a model representing user-specific customizations or preferences.
6. Recommendation: Serializes a model for storing recommendations associated with ListItem objects.

Key Features:
- Each serializer maps model fields to their respective JSON representations.
- Custom validation logic is implemented for ensuring required fields, particularly in the 
  GroupListSerializer, where the presence of a user is checked.
- The GroupListSerializer includes a custom method (get_shared_by_user_id) to retrieve the user who 
  shared a particular list.
- The extra_kwargs attribute is used in the ListItemSerializer to define custom requirements for 
  fields, like making the user field required and images optional.

Purpose:
The serializers are part of the API infrastructure and ensure that the applicationâ€™s models can 
easily be serialized into a format that can be sent or received over HTTP, making the app's data 
accessible for web or mobile interfaces.
